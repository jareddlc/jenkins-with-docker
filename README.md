This image was created to be a small layer on top of jenkins:alpine such that it could have access to the host's docker cli (via docker.sock). This image will run using the jenkins user, however it introduces a docker group and sets ownership of the docker.sock to it, additionally it adds the jenkins user to the list of sudoers.
